this is for personal use in case changes have to be redone manually, points aren't mapped to existing commits but often do correspond to specific commits

! for completing the existing PR 
    install-local.sh -> install-local.mjs
        ☀ add zx to package.json
        ☀ congifure networks.json in "($dfx networks-json-path)" to use 8080 port and subnet type (add check to verify this is how networks.json is configured? if there's no way to declare multiple networks)
        ☀ add ident-1.pem (and remove from dfx identity) to transfer funds to account id of balance holder
        ☀ wrap first build/deploy of invoice in try/catch as for now nns-ledger import in invoice canister code doesn't link correctly the first time when using dfx start --clean (does work immediatly if run build/deploy again)
    dfx.json
        ☀ remove existing ledger canister
        ☀ can use dfx nns import and configure, remove all but nns-ledger, add as a dependency to invoice canister
        ☀ add invoice subdirectory to declarations output path
    tests
        ☀ comment out last line of generated declaration index actor(s) so node testing works (or use node-compat in dfx json if declarations not end up being used otherwise)
        ☀ update http agents to point to 127.0.0.1:8080 (2 in icptests, 1 in maxCapacity)
        ☀ remove unused ledger declarations
        ☀ recompute account identifiers for identities used in e2e (which was also necessary for the icp transfer in the install script) as they've changed with newer versions of @dfinity/identity and @dfinity/principal
    canister code
        ☀ invoice.mo (and the mock invoice in examples) has undefined MEDIUM_CONTENT_SIZE usage which should be replaced with LARGE_CONTENT_SIZE which corresponds to the value according to the readme for meta constraints
        ☀ invoice.mo transfer fee check during verification revert existing, add error during invoice creation if invoice is created with an amount less than a minimum amount (ie 2x the transfer fee, since each paid invoice must have a balance of at least the transfer fee for the transfer to the invoice creator principal subaccount during verification to work), add E2E test demonstrating this works
    ☀ update readme to reflect changes using dfx nns ledger and zx install-local.mjs js bash script, and minimum amount due constraint

//The above marks all changes necessary for the existing PR to be finished. The rest is all of the edits to complete the RFP-BNT-2 bounty. 

! for the bounty itself 
    SEC-F12
        ☀ update pack-set.dhall to include aviate labs' ICOS (Internet Computer Open Services) so both the official dfinity and ICOS package sets are included (from ICOS array, crypto, encoding, hash, and principal as added dependencies)
        ☀ update vessel.dhall to reflect this ie: [ "base", "matchers", "base-0.7.3", "array", "crypto", "hash", "encoding", "principal" ]
        ☀ add new module with equivalent ICP related utility functions for account identifiers and subaccounts
        ☀ update unit tests to show equivalence works
        ☀ refactor unit tests to just use the new utility functions
        // phase one ( commit cedeb82dc6db02e9939bd2015ada7a68dd0dc6a2 )
        ☀ update dfx json to include ~ defaults build packtools vessel sources 
        ☀ refactor invoice/main.mo to use new ICP utilities module 
            - can drop getdestinationaccountidentifier (also from Types.mo)
            - create_invoice check token is valid at beginning then after other checks create payment address for invoice
            - get_balance create textual account identifier for principal subaccount
            - verify_invoice pass invoice subaccount and textual account identifier for principal subaccount as extra args (temporary)
            - transfer pull out textual account identifier of destination and create its blob form; create subaccount for transfer
            - get_account_identifier create textual account identifier of principal subaccount and return as text variant of account identifier type
            - accountIdentifierToBlob use switch to convert each account identifier variant type into blob form (with validation)
        ☀ refactor invoice/ICPLedger.mo to parse new (temporary) verify_invoice args
        -> NOTE: no other changes necessary (as of the commit) and E2E still work as is. 
        // phase two 
        * refactor main.mo and ICPLedger.mo to remove added arguments for letting ICPLedger.mo work without refactor for tests
            - in ICPLedger.mo balance can use ICPUtils.accountIdentifierFromValidText 
            - in ICPLedger.mo verifyInvoice can directly recreate the principalSubaccountAccountIdentifier and invoiceSubaccount from the invoice in args
        * drop Account/CRC32/Hex/Utils modules and remove imports from ICPLedger and main.mo
