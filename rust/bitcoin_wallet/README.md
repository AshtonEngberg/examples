# Bitcoin Wallet Example

## Summary

This example dapp shows how to build a Bitcoin wallet making use of the [Bitcoin intergration](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/concepts/bitcoin-integration.html).

This dapp is under active development and not ready to be used yet.
Once some parts of its functionality are implemented, this README will be updated accordingly with instructions on how to build and run the dapp.
